# COMP4206
COMP4206 Project

This is a simple simulation written in Python that creates a grid and adds agents to the grid. It then simulates the movement of agents on the grid.

The simulation infects a random agent on the grid and then simulates the spread of the infection throughout all agents on the grid.
